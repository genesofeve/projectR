An R package for creating projection matrices from gene weights extracted from
high dimensional genomic analysis.

The most up-to-date version of *projectR* can be installed directly from the
Github Repository:

## Installation
```
## Method 1 from Bioconductor
BiocManager::install("projectR")

## Method 2 from Github
BiocManager::install("genesofeve/projectR")
```
## Getting Started
We recommend going through the [vignette](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/projectR/inst/doc/projectR.pdf) and the [Bioinformatics article](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/11/3592/5804979) to learn more about **projectR**.
